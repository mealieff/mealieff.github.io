I am first-year PhD in Computer Science under the supervision of [Dr. Thai Le](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/) at the [ARKAI Lab](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/). My research explores speech and audio foundation models, prosody, and linguistic representation learning, with a central emphasis on data quality under constrained conditions, affective responsibility in AI systems, and multilingual speech technologies.

Prior to my PhD, I completed an M.A. in Computational Linguistics through the [Computational Linguistics program](https://cl.indiana.edu/) at Indiana University, where I was advised by [Dr. Sandra Kübler](https://linguistics.indiana.edu/about/faculty/kubler-sandra.html) and received significant mentorship from [Dr. Shobhana Chelliah](https://linguistics.indiana.edu/about/faculty/chelliah-shobhana.html) and [Dr. Shuju Shi](https://linguistics.indiana.edu/about/faculty/shuju-shi.html). 

You will notice my background extends multiple discliniplinary traditions. For more on my journey to CS.
