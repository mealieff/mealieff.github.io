## Research Projects

### Speech Emotion Labeling Using Reasoning Models
Developing advanced models that leverage reasoning capabilities to improve speech emotion recognition and labeling. This work focuses on creating more interpretable and accurate emotion classification systems by incorporating reasoning mechanisms into the emotion detection pipeline.

### Multilingual Speech Processing in End-to-End Systems
Working on end-to-end (E2E) neural architectures for multilingual speech processing, with a focus on improving cross-lingual transfer and reducing the need for language-specific resources. This project addresses challenges in building unified speech systems that can handle multiple languages effectively.

### Speech Enhancement for Emotion Recognition
Investigating speech enhancement techniques specifically designed to improve emotion recognition performance. This research explores how signal processing and deep learning methods can be combined to enhance emotional cues in speech signals while maintaining or improving emotion classification accuracy.

## Past Project Work

### Hate Speech Detection
**Balancing Multilabel Datasets for Effective Hate Speech Detection: A Study on Gab**  
Working on improving hate speech detection models through better dataset balancing techniques, with a focus on multilabel classification challenges. This project addresses ethical AI concerns in content moderation systems.


### Language Documentation Tools
**Making Use of Computational Tools for Language Documentation**  
Collaborating with Dr. Shobhana Chelliah on developing and applying computational tools for language documentation, particularly for endangered and under-resourced languages. This work combines my interests in computational linguistics and language preservation.

### Online Conspiracy Theory Research
**Countering Online Networked Conspiracy Theories (CONNECT)**  
Served as a Data Annotator for research focused on understanding and countering online conspiracy theories, contributing to annotation efforts for NLP models addressing misinformation and harmful content.
