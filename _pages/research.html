## Research Projects

### Hate Speech Detection
**Balancing Multilabel Datasets for Effective Hate Speech Detection: A Study on Gab**  
Working on improving hate speech detection models through better dataset balancing techniques, with a focus on multilabel classification challenges. This project addresses ethical AI concerns in content moderation systems.

### Multilingual Grammar Error Correction
**Dependency-Informed Attention for Multilingual Grammar Error Correction**  
Developing neural models that leverage syntactic dependency information to improve grammar error correction across multiple languages, with particular attention to under-resourced languages.

### Language Documentation Tools
**Making Use of Computational Tools for Language Documentation**  
Collaborating with Dr. Shobhana Chelliah on developing and applying computational tools for language documentation, particularly for endangered and under-resourced languages. This work combines my interests in computational linguistics and language preservation.

### Language Conservancy Internship
**Computational Linguistics for Language Preservation**  
Working as a Computational Linguist Intern at The Language Conservancy, developing tools and resources to support language documentation and preservation efforts for indigenous languages.

### Online Conspiracy Theory Research
**Countering Online Networked Conspiracy Theories (CONNECT)**  
Served as a Data Annotator for research focused on understanding and countering online conspiracy theories, contributing to annotation efforts for NLP models addressing misinformation and harmful content.
